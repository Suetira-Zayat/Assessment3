#Task 10 - Report on my design decisions for my site.

Why I designed it the way I did:

Banner:
The banner I have made consists of a photograph of Bath anI ahve added a gradient effect on it to allow the title 'City of Bath' to stand out more.
The title is bold and white as it will catch the viewers attention and attract them to continue looking through the website. Besides the title I have 
added another smaller title explaining when Bath was founded and the motto of the city. I have chosen different colours for these two headings, yellow
and blue. I chose yellow as it matches the colour scheme of Bath's architecture which consists of pale to dark yellow buildings. Additionally, I chose 
the blue colour for the motto as it contrasts the yellow heading beside it. This contrast is useful in keeping the viewer attracted as their eyes
naturally divert towards bright, different colours. The navigation banner names the company as 'Visit Places' and I have added a small logo beside it
consiting of an airplane. I chose this bootstrap icon because it contributes to the concept of travelling which is the whole purpose of the website.

Navigation bar:
I chose to use white and bold text within my navigation bar as it provides a clean, sophisiticated and modern look to the website. Furthermore, it matches 
the colour of the main heading and continues the colour scheme of whites and yellows. Additionally, the inactive link of the navigation bar shows a faded white
colour and when the user will hover or click, it will change to a block white colour. This allows the user to exactly know which pages they are on and 
can easily locate the pages they wish to explore.

Home page:
Under my banner I created a section including a picture on a dark background with text which describes the city in brief terms of location,culture and what it provides. 
This familiarises theuser with the city as they can read the two paragraphs while refering to the images and this will increase their liking towards the city. Futhermore, 
the static map I added in at the end of the home page is in the dark mode to match the dark background colour of the descriptive section above it. 

History page:
This page mainly consists of a main image relating to the history of Bath which links to the four separated paragraphs with headings underneath it. This page is the
most informative and detailed page as it provides a thorough descriptions about the important and exciting history of Bath.

Visit Page:
This page consist of two columns which include bootstrap cards. The background colour scheme of these cards were mainly grey and light teal to match the colour
of the river and the buildings in the banner image. 

Challenges faced:
One of the challenges I faced was ensuring my html tags were neat and organised as I was losing track of which tags I was working on. Therefore, this made
editing and adding changes rather difficult and I unfortunately got lost in my own html and CSS. However, I soon realised this issue could be resolved if I 
started to add html comment tags. This allowed me to easily and quickly identify what every section of different code was for and its purpose. This made the process 
more enjoyable as I was now controlling my code.

Another challenge I faced was at the start as I was using all three methods of using CSS: inline, internal and external and this made me confused at some points.
Therefore, I think next time I will simply use one method of linking to CSS rather than using all three.

The final challenge I faced was forgetting to close all tags as I would emmerse myself within the code that I would neglect the important baseline rules whhcih are
required for the code to work. I solved this issue by using w3 validator after I would make any changes or additions to my code as I went along. This ensured that 
all my pages successfuly validated and worked.
